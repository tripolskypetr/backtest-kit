# RiskContract

Contract for risk rejection events.

Emitted by riskSubject ONLY when a signal is REJECTED due to risk validation failure.
Used for tracking actual risk violations and monitoring rejected signals.

Events are emitted only when risk limits are violated (not for allowed signals).
This prevents spam and allows focusing on actual risk management interventions.

Consumers:
- RiskMarkdownService: Accumulates rejection events for report generation
- User callbacks via listenRisk() / listenRiskOnce()
