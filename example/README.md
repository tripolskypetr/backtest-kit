## 🔪 TRXUSDT January 2026 — Liquidity Harvesting

> **Hypothesis:** The Telegram channel publishes SHORT signals with average R:R of 0.375:1 and 106% deposit at risk at 25× leverage — mathematically guaranteed to lose. Fifteen minutes before each post a volume spike appears on the chart; the TP step multipliers and T5/SL ratio are identical across all signals, indicating an algorithm. If you reverse engineer the algorithm — liquidity is yours

### How it works

1. Signals are loaded from `assets/entry.jsonl` — 11 real posts from the Crypto Yoda channel, exported verbatim.
2. On each candle, `getSignal` checks if `publishedAt` matches the current minute and whether `closePrice` falls inside `entry.from..entry.to`.
3. Counter trend entry with trailing take and no fixed TP. SL is set to -0.5%

## 📰 BTCUSDT February 2026 — AI News Sentiment

> **Hypothesis:** an LLM reading live crypto/macro news every few hours can produce a directional bias (bullish / bearish / wait) that outperforms random on a sustained trending month.

### How it works

1. Every 4–8 hours, a Tavily search fetches the latest Bitcoin and macro headlines.
2. The raw news text is passed to a local Ollama model, which returns one of `bullish`, `bearish`, or `wait`.
3. `getSignal` opens a LONG on `bullish`, SHORT on `bearish`, and skips on `wait`. A conflicting forecast while a position is open triggers `commitClosePending` (sentiment flip).
4. Positions exit on trailing take-profit (1% drawdown from peak) or stop-loss (1% from entry). No fixed TP target.

## 🪂 BTCUSDT March 2026 — SHORT DCA Ladder

> **Hypothesis:** in a high-volatility, mean-reverting month, dollar-cost averaging into every spike upward raises the blended cost basis enough to hit a 0.5% profit target on each reversal.

### How it works

1. `getSignal` opens a SHORT on every new pending signal via `Position.moonbag` with a 25% hard stop and $100 cost.
2. While active, `commitAverageBuy` fires on each ping if the current price moves outside a ±1–5% band around the last entry and fewer than 10 rungs have been added.
3. The position closes as soon as blended portfolio PNL reaches +0.5% via `commitClosePending`.

## 🧗 BTCUSDT April 2026 — LONG DCA Ladder

> **Hypothesis:** in a trending bull month, dollar-cost averaging into every dip lowers the blended cost basis enough to hit a 3% profit target faster and more often than a single-entry approach.

### How it works

1. `getSignal` opens a LONG on every new pending signal via `Position.moonbag` with a 25% hard stop and $100 cost.
2. While active, `commitAverageBuy` fires on each ping if the current price falls outside a ±1–5% band around the last entry and fewer than 10 rungs have been added.
3. The position closes as soon as blended portfolio PNL reaches +3% via `commitClosePending`.
